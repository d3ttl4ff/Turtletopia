Its goal is to preserve endangered turtle species, and it is one among several hatcheries on the southern coast of the island. Initially launched as a community initiative to safeguard the region's biodiversity, it has developed into a complete hatchery and rescue center, where teams work tirelessly day and night to analyze, nurture and shield multiple species of turtles.</p>
                    <p>It takes care of five different turtle species, namely Olive Ridley, Leatherback, Loggerhead, Hawksbill, and Green Turtles. The centre has modern facilities including water tanks to care for the newborn turtles and adult species that have been rescued due to injuries. Visitors can observe the unique sight of turtle egg-laying, with the eggs carefully placed in neat sand mounds. The centre closely monitors each of these mounds to track the hatching process of the turtle eggs.

            <p>Sri Lanka is home to five different species of sea turtles, all of which can be found in various locations along the
            country's coastline. Here is some brief information regarding each of the species:</p>

                        Kosgoda,
                        Habaraduwa, and Galle.

            <div>
                <p>A turtle hatchery is a protected area where sea turtles can safely lay their eggs and where the hatched baby turtles can crawl out into the ocean. These hatcheries play a crucial role in the conservation of sea turtles, as they help to increase the survival rates of turtle hatchlings and protect them from predators, poachers, and other dangers. In addition, hatcheries provide an opportunity for scientists and conservationists to study turtle populations and develop strategies for their conservation.
                </p><br>
                <p>Turtle hatcheries are particularly important in areas where sea turtle populations are declining due to habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and other human-related factors. By providing a safe environment for turtle eggs to hatch and baby turtles to grow, hatcheries help to maintain and restore turtle populations. However, hatcheries are not a long-term solution to the problem of declining turtle populations, as they do not address the root causes of the problem. Therefore, hatcheries must be complemented with efforts to address the threats facing turtle populations, such as habitat protection, pollution reduction, and sustainable fishing practices.

                <p class="eighth-section-paragraph-1">Protecting sea turtles is crucial because they play a vital role in the marine ecosystem. These gentle creatures help
                maintain healthy seagrass beds and coral reefs by grazing on the plants that grow there, which creates space for new
                growth. Additionally, sea turtles serve as a food source for many predators, helping to balance the ocean's food chain.
                Sadly, many turtle populations are threatened by human activities such as poaching, habitat destruction, and pollution.

                Hatcheries play an important role in turtle conservation efforts by providing a safe place for turtle eggs to hatch and
                young turtles to grow before being released into the wild. Hatcheries protect the eggs from natural predators and human
                activities, which can damage or destroy nests. By incubating the eggs and keeping the hatchlings safe during the
                vulnerable early stages of their lives, hatcheries help to increase the survival rates of turtle populations.
