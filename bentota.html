                <h3>Bentota Turtle Hatchery</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>The hatchery serves as a sanctuary for various species of sea turtles, including the Green Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Olive Ridley Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, and Leatherback Turtle. It provides a safe environment for these turtles to lay their eggs, ensuring their successful hatching and subsequent release into the ocean.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One of the highlights of visiting the hatchery is the opportunity to witness the release of baby turtles into the sea. This awe-inspiring experience allows visitors to witness the beginning of these tiny turtles' incredible journey as they make their way into the vast ocean, navigating the waves and embarking on their lifelong adventure.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Bentota Sea Turtle Hatchery also actively participates in research programs aimed at understanding the behavior and life cycles of sea turtles. By collecting valuable data and conducting scientific studies, the hatchery contributes to the overall conservation efforts and helps raise awareness about the importance of protecting these endangered species.</p>

                        <h4>The Importance</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>Turtle eggs that have been left on their own are vulnerable to predators and helpless against them. Additionally, there is a chance that local fishermen will find the eggs and sell them to poachers, who would then sell them on the black market. The hatcheries address this by paying the fisherman more for their eggs, which incentivizes them to keep bringing in the imperiled eggs to a safer area.</p>
                    </div>
                    <img src="images/pollution2.jpg" alt="">

                        <h4>Conservation Effort</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>When the eggs arrive at the hatchery, they are carefully buried in sand until they break free of their shells, at which point they are transported and put into tanks where they will spend the first few days of their life. This increases their chances of surviving by giving them a chance to get stronger before being returned to the perils of the water. In this way, several turtle species are preserved.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>The newborn turtles are released on the beach at dusk, and you can watch them make their way back to the ocean. Visitors are urged to use caution while young turtles are released back into the water. Loud sounds, bright lights, and flash photography are prohibited because they could cause newborn turtles to mistake them for the moon over the water, which would prevent them from finding their way back home.</p>
