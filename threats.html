            <hr>
            <p>Over the past two centuries, sea turtles have faced significant threats that have led to their disappearance from certain regions and placed them on the verge of extinction. Human activities have been a major cause of these disturbances in the ocean ecosystems, impacting sea turtles in various ways.</p>

                <h3>Habitat Loss and Degradation</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                Sea turtles rely on specific coastal habitats for nesting, as well as nearshore and offshore environments for feeding and migration. However, human activities such as coastal development, beach erosion, and habitat destruction pose significant threats. The construction of resorts, coastal infrastructure, and coastal armoring can disrupt nesting sites and alter vital beach dynamics. Moreover, pollution from urbanization and agriculture can degrade water quality,
                negatively impacting seagrass beds and coral reefs, which are crucial for foraging. These habitat losses limit the availability of suitable nesting areas and disrupt the turtles' life cycle, leading to declines in sea turtle populations.

                <br>
                <p>The warming of the Earth's climate has profound effects on sea turtles. Rising temperatures lead to the feminization of hatchlings since temperature determines the sex of the offspring. As nesting beaches become warmer, a greater proportion of females are produced, skewing the sex ratios and potentially affecting future population dynamics. Additionally, climate change affects sea levels, resulting in the loss of nesting beaches and the inundation of critical nesting areas. Changes in ocean currents and temperature availability of food for turtles and disrupting their migratory routes. Climate change poses a complex and multifaceted threat to sea turtles, exacerbating their vulnerability and hindering their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Pollution poses a grave threat to sea turtles. Marine debris, especially plastic, poses entanglement and ingestion risks. Sea turtles can become entangled in discarded fishing nets, lines, and other debris, which can impair their ability to swim, feed, and breathe, leading to injuries and death. Ingestion of plastic debris is also a significant concern, as turtles often mistake plastic bags and other items for food, causing blockages, internal injuries, and malnutrition. Moreover, pollution from oil spills and chemical contaminants further contaminates their habitats, leading to long-term health issues and impairing their reproductive abilities</p>

                <h3>Bycatching</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Sea turtles often become unintentionally caught in fishing gear, known as bycatch. This occurs when fishing nets, longlines, and trawls capture turtles along with targeted fish species. The turtles can drown or sustain injuries from entanglement, impacting their survival. Bycatch is a significant threat, particularly in commercial fisheries operating
                in the same areas where sea turtles feed and migrate. Implementation of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) and other bycatch reduction measures in fishing gear is essential to mitigate this threat and minimize the incidental capture of sea turtles</p>

                <br>
                <p>Illegal hunting of sea turtles and their eggs remains a persistent threat in some regions. Poaching occurs for various purposes, including the consumption of turtle meat, use of their shells in the creation of jewelry and other products, and the collection of eggs for human consumption. Poaching activities are often driven by cultural beliefs, traditional practices, and black market trade. The demand for turtle products puts additional pressure on sea turtle populations, exacerbating their decline and undermining conservation efforts</p>
